      "We disagree on this one, Justanother. Hubbard's \"\"claim to fame\"\" was not as a writer on diverse topics (though he did write other sorts of fiction), but specifically as an author of stories and novellas in the science fiction pulps, especially Campbell's Astounding, where, as you say, he first published Dianetics material.  Just as A.E Van Vogt (another Dianetics supporter) or Robert Heinlein would properly be billed as science fiction writers, so should Hubbard.  It is clearly the one thing for which he was best known in 1950, and it remains an important part of his career.  There's no shame in it.  \"\n",

      "Anyways, regarding about the 2000 New Flyer C40HF buses (5000-5222) they were at divisions 3, 5, 7 and 18.

      "Hi.  I am a rather biology noob, hopefully this question doesn't sound strange.  I am curious as to whether it is possible for stem cell creation to one day reach a peak where we can replace animal Slaughterhouse?  Forget about the economic factor for a minute.  Is it theoretically possible to feed a nation with meat that was grown 100% in a lab and not killed from any animal??  I had a thought that animals would benefit greatly from this.   \n",
      "Um, you could grow either stem cells or non-stem cells in some sort of cell culture system for food, I guess, but it seems like a hideously expensive exercise & you would likely use animal or animal-derived products in their growth. The problem would still be the texture and the flavour''.\n",
      "Realistically, it would be easier to feed everyone with soya flavoured to taste like meat. I've read that the entire underdeveloped world could be easily fed using the grain the US alone feeds its livestock (not sure if that's true though). Eating meat is costsly, and in vitro meat would be even moreso. The best way to save the animals would be to go vegetarian... but I still like a good steak.  \n",
      "So you are saying there is never going to be an answer since taste and flavor can never be produced in a lab?  \n",
      "Not never, just that I suspect that taste and flavour will be greater hurdles than growing cells. I don't see why it has to be stem cells that are grown as \"\"meat\"\" - actually you would be better off growing muscle cells, as it is the muscle (and some fat) that is what is in a typical steak.  \n",

Most act like the \"\"boiling frog\"\" and sit while the temperature rises, never moving until too late and \"\"Beyonce\"\" runs 26 seconds (or Assange 18). I advised Jimbo, to add \"\"More pillars\"\" where Performance becomes a major priority, like Civility or NPOV, rather than \"\"personal preference to see results\"\" in the same hour, while they demand the cite-tools still work. You might know I've had severe rejections trying to defuse essay wp:PERF, and explain how the Titanic sank because \"\"Don't worry\"\" thwarted other people from acting or improving (the ship design included ample lifeboats rejected by others). This year, with the Costa Concordia in Italy, passengers worried enough about the tilting ship to call land-based police to complain the ship seemed damaged while crew pretended \"\"Don't worry\"\". Enough. I think we are reaching \"\"critical mass\"\" to move forward here. The next compromise consensus supports all parameters (as demanded pronto), and auto-runs the quick citations, with later promises to \"\"fix\"\" {Citation/core} where possible, and still support those cite-tools which generate {cite_web} calls and such. It is a hideously complex upgrade, with over 23 forks as {cite_book}, {cite_video}, {cite_document}, {cite_press_release}, {cite_encyclopedia}, even \"\"{citeweb}\"\" or \"\"{cite web}\"\" but fixing the most-used will cure the speed problems. Plus, the talk-page already warns to deprecate \"\"surname1\"\" for \"\"last1\"\" where 3 fewer alias parameters could mean 2x faster for that parameter, perhaps next year. Beyond the complex fast {Fcite} templates, the rapid {cite_quick} runs 10x-12x faster, so \"\"Assange\"\" can drop from 18 to 5-second edit-preview. I already saved some temporary revisions to \"\"prove\"\" Assange can reformat in 5 seconds:\n",

      "Not to burst your petty little power trip, but it isn't exactly fair game to ban someone just because he was right and you were proven wrong. When someone accuses another of being an 'anti-semite' just because the ADL has labelled him as such, I want to point out to to the Wikipedia audience that however horrible it may be, 'anti-semitism' actually originated from the United States, not Nazi-Germany, though it later adopted it from the likes of Madison Grant and Charles Davenport. Wikipedia's own article on Henry Ford states as much, yet when I bring it up in a Talk section, I get accused by the likes of you for vandalism and banned.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the sheer height of hypocrisy that you can go around calling people like me a 'crank' and 'conspiracy theorist', yet I get BANNED by you just because I call you a 'deceptive little creature', which you clearly have demonstrated you are. You can CALL ME all sorts of names, yet I in return am not allowed that privilege. You are deliberately colluding with THF and Collect (two other sockpuppets on Prescott Bush's page) to get rid of as much 'inconvenient' information as possible. Perhaps it's just because you're really clueless and really don't know alot - that would be at least the half-way respectable scenario, and the least weighing on your conscience.\n",
      "\n",
      "You want your audience (who I presume you want to delude, that is, unless you really DID NOT KNOW Henry Ford published The Elders Of Zion) to remain in a paradigm - without ever knowing where anti-semitism originated from and what a joke it is to see the ones who PROMOTED the concept of 'racial purity' and 'Aryan superiority' to Hitler to remain free of persecution. You use that 'ploy', that 'slogan', 'anti-semite', 'crank', as a silencing technique. It's a deceptive con-game, especially when you never get at the heart of the matter - where the anti-semitism came from, who started the ball rolling, and hey, guess what? The source of origin is a very unlikely one, and very unfortunate and inconvenient indeed for the self-righteous Americans always eager to trot out charges of 'anti-semitism'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately for you, and your sources, Prescott Bush's collusion with the Nazis is a well-established fact, and is well-documented in numerous high-profile books on the subject, including Trading With The Enemy: An Expose of the Nazi-American Money Plot. What you have constructed thus far are 'strawmen' arguments and falling back on 'guilt by association'. You peddle establishment sources as the ultimate harbinger of truth, perhaps KNOWING or NOT KNOWING the complete collusion of mainstream news with the establishment. More unfortunate for you, still, is that President Calvin Coolidge, Woodrow Wilson, Margaret Sanger, the father of JFK and countless other Americans clearly believed in the Nordic/Aryan races' superiority and viewed the Nazis as good. Worse still is that FDR refused to take Jewish refugees from Nazi-Germany. Even worse, university professors were making statements in 1936 to the tune of 'Hitler is beating us at our own game - race hygiene and sterilization'. This is all documented in books such as Edwin Black's 'War Against The Weak' - and don't come with your silly, puny little slogan such as 'conspiracy theorist' just because you don't care and don't want to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike you and your petty insults and one-liners, I can back up all these claims with facts and more. I can only conclude that you're a weak-minded yuppie who really does not CARE about the facts, but whether or not you can hang out with your equally deceptive Wikipedians, gain some 'street' credits and keep people in a deceitful paradigm while slandering people who want to break out of your make-believe reality. And of course, being an American, you want to uphold this concocted, grand noble myth that you're the good guys and you fought Nazism. I can only tell you haven't looked into the eugenics history of your own country, or the Royal Institute of Intl. Affairs Conference of 1938.

This is often underlined on official documents, as it is often the second or third name in a list, even though it is the person's main name: the idea of first names being more important than middle names, as is usually the case in Anglo-Saxon cultures, is unknown.” I think this section is quite dated. My grandfather (born in 1904) had a Rufname, which was actually his second Vorname, but nowadays this is rather uncommon in Germany. Legally, one can use any of the Vornamen one was given as one's preferred Rufname and even change it without any prerequisite, so if the current German minister for economics Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg wanted to, he could use any of his 10 Vornamen as the name to be called with (except for the Maria, I guess -)). But in reality, such things rarely happen. Btw, the example shows not only girls can have many Vornamen, though 10 is a bit excessive, such large numbers of names are mostly confined to former nobility. There are even court decisions limiting the number of Vornamen, a mother wasn't allowed to give her child 12 Vornamen, but only 5.\n",

      "\"==Correct and True Etymology of English words \"\"Myth, Mythology\"\"==\n",
      "Greek μυθολογια \"\"legend, storytelling\"\" is derived from μυθος \"\"speech, thought, story, myth\"\", itself of unknown origin. English mythology is in use since the 15th century, in the meaning \"\"an exposition of myths\"\". The current meaning of \"\"body of myths\"\" itself dates to 1781 (OED). The adjective mythical dates to 1678; English use of myth is later, first attested in 1830, in its original English meaning of \"\"untrue story\"\":\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"These two stories are very good illustrations of the origin of myths, by means of which, even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous history.\"\" Westminster Review 12:44 (1830)\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the earliest known usage of \"\"myth\"\" in English. In case anyone didn't know, in 1830 English \"\"fabulous\"\" doesn't mean \"\"wonderfully aesthetic\"\", it is the adjectival form of \"\"fable\"\", that is referring to a fantasy or fairytale.  In 1830 the term \"\"myth\"\" was new, so it carries what we call a gloss, things \"\"by means of which even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous (i.e., fictional) history.\"\".  This was not only the original use of the word, but the original academic use of the word, note the source, Westminster Review. That is still the way most all people define \"\"myth\"\" today.  It's for reasons like this, that Wikipedia is so notorious for its mental disconnect with mainstream thought, and its enforced use of its own internal terminology / jargon, or to put it less nicely, doublespeak.  (ውይይት) \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2005, a single-purpose account added \"\"mythology categories\"\" to a wide range of articles including Death and Resurrection of Jesus, Virgin Birth, and Transubstantiation, creating a huge uproar.  The outcome of the discussions then was overwhelmingly to reject the categories as imflammatory and inappropriate.  It was agreed at that time that theological and scriptural articles do not fall into the category of \"\"mythology\"\" and today, none of these articles are so categorised, apart from Noah's Ark.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Just last month, WP:RELIGION undertook to move the article \"\"Yoruba mythology\"\" to Yoruba religion.  This is because the term \"\"mythology\"\" is held to be demeaning, because Yoruba religion is still practised today, and the Yoruba who practice it constitute a significant viewpoint.    It is indeed regrettable that so much resistance is facing the prospect of extending the same consideration to the canonical Book of Genesis.  The Churches have drawn the line by indicating which books they consider canonical, inspired texts.  Genesis is among them with no exceptions as far as I know. What gives Wikipedia the right to draw the line so as to exclude other Biblical Books from \"\"mythology\"\", but include the stories of Genesis?  No books that are considered sacred scripture by ANY large religion of today should be portrayed as \"\"mythology\"\".  That's simple common sense.  We shouldn't call the Quran \"\"mythology\"\" either, we shouldn't call anyone's sacred books widely adhered to today \"\"mythology\"\".    (ውይይት) \n",
      "\n",
      "Now things like Hesiod and Orpheus are another story, I think the reason Hesiod and Orpheus have conventionally been referred to as \"\"mythology\"\" for some time is because no significant numbers of people have ever come forward claiming to believe these books to be historical or literally true since the year 400.  At least I will go out on a limb and say I don't know of any, not a single one. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's pretty safe to say they have been discarded, and nobody objects to the conventional use of \"\"mythology\"\" for these.  But please realize that this is not the case with Christian, Muslim or Bahai writings, nor indeed the writings of many other living religions.  (ውይይት) \n",

The British government continued in its attempt to tax the colonists without their consent and the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the Seven Years War 1756–1763, the British Empire was deep in debt. To help pay some of the costs of the newly expanded empire, the Parliament of Great Britain/British Parliament decided to levy new taxes on the colonies of British America. Previously, through the Trade and Navigation Acts, Parliament had used taxation to regulate the trade of the empire. However, with the Sugar Act of 1764, Parliament sought for the first time to tax the colonies for the specific purpose of raising revenue. American colonists initially objected to the Sugar Act for economic reasons, but before long they recognized that there were constitutional issues involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was argued that the Bill of Rights 1688 protected British subjects from being taxed without the consent of a truly representative Parliament. Because the colonies elected no members of the British Parliament, many colonists viewed Parliament's attempt to tax them as a violation of the constitutional doctrine of taxation only by consent. Some British politicians countered this argument with the theory of \"\"virtual representation\"\", which maintained that the colonists were in fact represented in Parliament even though they elected no members. This issue, only briefly debated following the Sugar Act, became a major point of contention following Parliament's passage of the 1765 Stamp Act. The Stamp Act proved to be wildly unpopular in the colonies, contributing to its repeal the following year, along with the lack of substantial revenue being raised.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implicit in the Stamp Act dispute was an issue more fundamental than taxation and representation: the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.[4] Parliament provided its answer to this question when it repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 by simultaneously passing the Declaratory Act, which proclaimed that Parliament could legislate for the colonies \"\"in all cases whatsoever\"\".[5]\n",

      "The British government's belief that the colonists would accept \"\"external\"\" taxes resulted from a misunderstanding of the colonial objection to the Stamp Act. The colonists' objection to \"\"internal\"\" taxes did not mean that they would accept \"\"external\"\" taxes; the colonial position was that any tax laid by Parliament for the purpose of raising revenue was unconstitutional.[8] \"\"Townshend's mistaken belief that Americans regarded internal taxes as unconstitutional and external taxes constitutional\"\", wrote historian John Phillip Reid, \"\"was of vital importance in the history of events leading to the Revolution.\"\"[11] The Townshend Revenue Act received the royal assent on 29 June 1767.[12] There was little opposition expressed in Parliament at the time. \"\"Never could a fateful measure have had a more quiet passage\"\", wrote historian Peter Thomas.[12]\n",

      "The Revenue Act was passed in conjunction with the Indemnity Act of 1767,[13] which was intended to make the tea of the British East India Company more competitive with smuggled Dutch tea.[14] The Indemnity Act repealed taxes on tea imported to England, allowing it to be re-exported more cheaply to the colonies. This tax cut in England would be partially offset by the new Revenue Act taxes on tea in the colonies.[15] The Revenue Act also reaffirmed the legality of writs of assistance, or general search warrants, which gave customs officials broad\n",

The first part seemed to be putting me in my place  when you could have written a note on my talk page.  Now that you've explained your position, I understand.  If you find any others that I've uploaded, it's not necessary to post anything on my talk page.  I understand what you're saying, although I disagree with one part of it regarding film publicity photos, which were mass-distributed, sometimes without registering for copyright.  We don't know which are free and which are not, so it's not something that can be pursued, and I wouldn't try to claim any specific image falls into that group.     I still see problems with the Blondie image.   For one, it doesn't show anything vital that the article couldn't do without.  They're all living people, one of whom isn't even notable enough for a Wikipedia article, and they're not doing anything.   It only shows what they look like.   If it was a significant moment and if the photo showed them doing something that could not be adequately described in prose,  I could understand.  Regardless of what brought them together, the photo itself gives nothing except to show what they look like.   Given the degree of thought you've given to the actress photos, I don't understand why you accept a fair rationale saying \"\"they cannot be brought together because they live in three separate areas of the U.S.\"\" which is a false statement, contradicted by common sense - there are numerous ways they could be brought together - and by the very existence of the photo.  I'd accept a rationale that justified its use, but not that.  Still, you said you may even nominate it for deletion someday, but that it's not a priority, so you're obviously not completely convinced.  Anyway, I understand your viewpoint on the actress photos, so thank you for taking the time to convey your thoughts.  Regards.    \"\n",

      " OK, I'll grant to both of you that, in a perfect world, the interest factor is as important as everything else I've outlined ... but we are so far from a perfect world at DYK and there is so much that needs attention !  DYK has the opportunity to train editors early on and get articles off on the right foot ... instead, procedures and practices (there and at WIKICUP) encourage the churning out of deficient articles to gain perceived prizes.  And what happens to the \"\"interest factor\"\" is the same as what happens to prose and sourcing ... editors learn, indeed are encouraged by reviewers, to pad up their articles so that expansion/length is met, and there is often no regard for whether that padding is a) based on reliable sources, b) relevant to the article, or c) well written.  A similar thing happens when we demand interesting hooks ... that quickly becomes scandalously ridiculous tabloid style hooks, often with BLP issues or MEDRS issues of plain faulty hooks because non-reliable sources are used.  We have admins whose own DYK hooks are inaccurate, and are passed, based on blog sources. Recently. SO ... yes, interesting hooks might be one part of training new and experienced editors and encouraging responsible and policy-compliant editing, but there's a huge iceberg under that tip at DYK that is not being addressed because the few qualified reviewers who are active there cannot keep up with the volume, and we have several entrenched DYK regulars who either don't care about copyvio and reliable sources or simply and still after many years of editing do not even understand core policies.  There is a need to address the whole picture not just \"\"lame hooks\"\" and the whole picture cannot be corrected unless you work with the few clueful regulars there to deal with the several who lack clue, impose their will, and routinely place deficient articles on the mainpage.   DYK will never be eliminated (it probably should be because it is responsible for so much truly bad content that will never be cleaned up), so can we at least work to improve reviewing there ?  A slowdown in volume would help, along with an elimination of QPQ so that knowledgeable reviewers can assure our mainpage is being used responsibly.  But part of that is dealing with the experienced \"\"leaders\"\" at DYK who don't know and won't enforce policy and good editing practice ... work with the few who do.  (Talk) \"\n",

      "Posted on 29 August, 2006\n",
      "\n",
      " Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. \n",
      "\n",
      "The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. \n",
      "\n",
      "Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 \n",
      "\n",
      "A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” \n",
      "\n",
      "As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Worship Rights \n",
      "\n",
      "In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue?

He is currently bricking it, and revising like mad, so please excuse him if he doesn't reply to a petty plea for attention within one and a half hours. Kek, here's a polite request: stay out of my own business. Any editor who edits Wikipedia for more than two minutes a day is guarenteed to get into a dispute about any one of an infinite number of different things, and I'm no exception to this rule. Pointing things like this out to me on my talk page is disruptive, and, in my book, constitutes trolling. Continued trolling will, of course, be ultimatley quashed with a block. Count yourself warned. And, while your at it, heed what Keeper has to say above. He's making perfect sense. Keeper, I thank you ;). Now, if you'll excuse me, I have by tomorrow to read over bound states (parity, degeneracy and the finite square well potential), eigenfunctions (superposition, completeness, orthogonality and the meaning of the expansion coefficients), hermitian operators, orthonormal sets and derivation of the expansion coefficients (normalisation of and expectation values in terms of the expansion coefficients), commutators (implications for observations, eigenfunction sets), Ehrenfest's Theorum and the Correspondence Principal.

And that Boston Globe article section that is key is this \"\"Backers of the GamerGate movement say the behavior of a few extremists is being used to smear their entire movement. “You can’t say that all people who support GamerGate hate women, just because one person in GamerGate might really hate women,” said PAX East attendee Andrew Sampson, a 20-year-old software developer from Atlanta. Sampson insisted GamerGate isn’t a war on women, but on corruption and dishonesty in video game journalism. “Video game journalists for the longest time have been colluding together,” said Sampson. “Basically taking bribes, taking offers to publish positive reviews.”\"\". That's completely fair to use to explain the self-stated goals. To say \"\"No, we can't use them because non-GG say the are something else\"\" is a violation of objectivity and impartialness.

      "Hello, everyone. I have read that many of you are unsatisfied with articles in wiki that do not reflect accuracy in information. Such articles are produced by authors who have manifested a tendency towards some bias. In the great majority of the cases, the bias is personal. In other cases, the bias is based upon false information. Despite the info contributors presented - along with their solid references - they were completely ignored and their sources deleted without proper review by the authors. In such cases, the actions of these authors were somehow upheld and defended by wiki editors. Therefore, I have decided to create an article that yields as much accuracy as possible without any personal leanings. This is what wikipedia is is meant to be, which we all know is a long departure from what it is doing now. If any of you would like to contribute to this article, you are free to do so.

Some more detail about his earlier life is probably available, but it would need a lot of leg-work around newspaper cuttings libraries to find it, and many newspaper archives of this nature went in a skip years ago without digital copies being made.

A section in the article about rabbinic traditions is fine, but every history I've ever seen of the period relies mostly on Josephus, and assumes the (much later) rabbinic materials to be of limited value for determining the actual history of the period.\n",

      "“This section was started with discussion of \"\"bias in favor of Darwin's theory\"\" raising the issue of misrepresentation of Darwin by anti-evolutionists, and as discussed above, we have to give due weight to the overwhelming scientific majority view on the basic subject of evolution.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I certainly agree with that. \n",
      "\n",
      "But on the issue of using “realised”, I just have a couple of things to say. But as a preamble, if you like, I want to make the distinction between a theory and the reality that scientists etc test it against (I’m not being insulting, I assume everyone knows this already, but I’m making a case). Scientists don’t “prove” theories are true. But by conducting experiments they falsify the “bad” theories (again I assume you know this and obviously this is in agreement with the philosophy of Karl Popper).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now,  I think it’s bad practice to state things in such a way that a theory sounds like it’s the “truth” (meaning in perfect agreement with reality) because it destroys this distinction (between theory, or scientific fact, and reality or truth. To say that “X realised that Y”, where Y is a theory, is suggesting that Y is “in perfect agreement with reality”. Now, I think the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” does correspond perfectly with reality, but I also think we need to remember that it is still a theory (nothing is proven, remember, according to Popper) consistent with the general scientific method and perspective I already briefly outlined. Of course, in the case of evolution, someone arguing like this sounds rather silly  - it sounds like you’re being pedantic bordering on obsessive. Of course not all theories are the same - Popper would argue that theories that have “survived” criticism and rigorous testing are more “corroborated” (but never fully verified). But even if you wanted to make some exceptions, like the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors”, for the sake of scientific consistency, I think we should refrain from using “realised” in this context (incidentally, in regards to making exceptions, I certainly wouldn’t make any exceptions in respect to the sources given by David Wilson - these seem to me to be much more egregious cases of the word “realised”).\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, so much for theory. As far as concrete help is concerned, have you thought about deleting “who realised that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” altogether?  You probably know more about the history of evolution than I do, but I thought that this idea didn’t actually come from Darwin (I could be wrong, of course). But if it does, what about “Charles Robert Darwin FRS (12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist who first proposed the fact that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and also the scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection” or some variation on this?\n",

Then, by chance, somebody found out the link to the \"\"Stadtzeitung für Freiburg\"\" and the erroneous correction could be reverted. Notice that if there had been no documentation of the \"\"Stadtzeitung für Freiburg\"\" online, but only, say, in a press archive in Freiburg, or if nobody had made the effort to verify the verifiability, the error would not have been detected, and the \"\"truth\"\" would now be, erroneously, \"\"Stattzeitung\"\".

      "But let us apply this to another case, take Anton van Hooff, who is in charge to turn King's evidence for \"\"pseudo-science\"\", \"\"severe methodological flaws\"\" and \"\"factual errors\"\". Of course, he has written this, among several name-callings, so this is verifiable. But can we take it seriously? If we look closer we see that the first accusation of van Hooff towards Carotta was to not have taken into account the well known Tacitus-passage about Nero and the \"\"christians\"\". But since Carotta had treated it in detail, van Hooff was exposed, because he had shown that he had attacked a book without having read it, so that he himself was convicted of the \"\"severe methodological flaws\"\" and \"\"factual errors\"\" he tried to impute to other people. The subsequent escalation with the accusation of \"\"pseudo-science\"\" was only his embarrassing attempt to divert from the lack of professionality he had shown. This, too, can be verified. The question is then: Which verification is relevant?\n",

Looking closer we can also verify that he was never a professor, and is by now a teacher in a secondary school, as he himself stated in a newspaper article. So what have we truly verified? That he is a confidence trickster who let himself be called a professor without actually being one, in order to improve his authority as an alleged important scholar? If we look to the list of publications he is giving there, we see that he is speaking of \"\"numerous books and articles\"\" but specifies only one title. Modesty or showing-off?\n",

      "Van Hooff being a notorious polemicist, can his accusations be taken seriously? Nobody does it in The Netherlands (why is there no article about him in the Dutch WP? – The only Antoon van Hooff listed there is a zoo director, who was ashamed of the homonymy), but he is taken seriously here, in the English WP where most \"\"judges\"\" do not even understand Dutch. Why? Because it is so stated in the German WP already? If we take a look at the history there, we can verify that somebody had first put the article in the category \"\"Pseudowissenschaft\"\" (pseudo-science), but then, this being not allowed because libelous, they \"\"discovered\"\" \"\"Van Hooff\"\", taking him as \"\"proof\"\", without examining his credibility, happy to have the possibility to maintain their libelous allegation in an appearance of legality: it is \"\"only\"\" a quotation! ;-)\n",

As you can see for some reason this ATRIAN has been following me from article to article vadalizing them and just beeing an all around pain in the bum.

I also wonder how Atrian knows that i didnt have promision to use that text.?   Wouldnt it be possible that i know the webmaster that wrote it for the goverment page that i copied it from?  WHat reasearch has he done into this?  The man is a panzy.  And he was the first to send me a nasty comment.  I belive i have the right to defend my self.   Thank you.\n",

      "Unless you can provide some reliable direct evidence for your claim, please stop debating the issue. You are failing to accept just how poorly the Jaguar fared. Only one source actually contradicts the currently-used figure, and the site, MSN Tech & Gadgets, often contains factual errors. Atari itself stated that it \"\"has placed no manufacturing orders for the Jaguar console since mid-1995. Based on current and expected sales and inventory levels, Atari does not intend to pursue additional Jaguar manufacturing.\"\" From what I can see, nothing in any subsequent filing indicates that any more Jaguar hardware was ever produced. The company constantly refers to a \"\"substantial inventory\"\" that it is trying to sell off, despite substantial write-downs. Regardless of what you believe about the sales of the Jaguar, nothing has been provided that would justify a change. I would recommend you review Wikipedia:Verifiability, as well as Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines#Maintain Wikipedia policy, which you continue to ignore. \"\"It is usually a misuse of a talk page to continue to argue any point that has not met policy requirements.\"\" In fact, since you seem to have trouble grasping the principle, I would recommend that you not post anything unless it includes a source, even in talk pages.   \"\n",

      "\"== Purges in the Red Army ==\n",
      "\n",
      "The late 1930s saw the so-called \"\"Purges of the Red Army cadres\"\", occurring against the historical background of the Great Purge. The Purges had the objective of cleansing the Red Army of the \"\"politically unreliable element\"\", mainly among the higher-ranking officers. This inevitably provided a convenient pretext for settling personal vendettas and eventually resulted in a witch hunt. Some observers believe that the Purges weakened the Red Army considerably, but this remains a hotly debated subject. Many commentators overlook the fact that the Red Army grew significantly in numbers during the peak of the Purges. In 1937, the Red Army numbered around 1.3 million, and it grew to almost three times that number by June 1941. This necessitated quick promotion of junior officers, often despite their lack of experience or training, with obvious grave implications. In another important consideration, by the end of the Purges the pendulum swung back, restoring and promoting many of the purged officers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently declassified data indicate that in 1937, during the culmination of the Purges, the Red Army had 114,300 officers, of whom 11,034 suffered repression and did not gain rehabilitation until 1940.

      "The Bible in Matthew says to put your light on the top of the basket, not under it.  The foundation of notability is identifiability, which I think the congregation at KUC, insisting that they are not a building, is successfully obfuscating by having no pictures of the building on their website.  To quantify this statement, it took me eight full man hours to find KUC on a Google satellite map.  It was easy enough to locate the intersection, but looking at [the picture] on Google, there is no reason to suspect that the building in the distance is the church.  Zeroing in on the actual location was finally accomplished by finding a picture of the church on the web site of the architects of the church, and comparing this street view with the aerial view available from Google.  (Of course, by the liberal definition, I still haven't found the church on Google, because the church is not a building.  If this is your personal view, then you need to consider that this congregation is not currently WP:N notable.)  So assuming that the congregation feels righteous and will not help in identifying their we-are-not-a-building building, I'd suggest that the first thing you could do to improve the notability of KUC is to work on its identifiability: (1) get the maps specifically including Google improved, i.e., get the Google place marker on the building instead of in the middle of the street intersection, (2) does the church have a street address, (3) make your own web site with pictures of the building identifying the building as owned by KUC.  Include pictures of the view toward the surrounding area, such as showing where people park on Sunday morning, the Kippax Fair, and the \"\"adjacent park\"\" where the Christmas Day 2005 services were held. Is the maximum seating capacity of the sanctuary recorded by the fire department?  If there is a sign posted to that effect, the sign could be photographed.\n",

It doesn't matter how long you've lived in whatever region; that doesn't mean you know anything about the dialect that's spoken there.  No offense, that's just how it is.  I lived in the Midland for most of my life, but that doesn't mean I know squat about the dialect spoken there.  I'm sure there are linguists who know way more than I do about the Midland dialect.  I can speak it, but that doesn't mean I know much about it.  People don't seem to understand this concept.  Also, personal experience doesn't mean anything on Wikipedia, no matter how true or false it is.  It's called \"\"original research\"\" here.  There's no need to get angry about this stuff; it's just linguistics; it's not like anyone insulted your mother or your cat or whatever you hold dear.  Keep in mind also that it is possible to live in a region one's entire life and not speak with the accent associated with that region, i.e., some people in the South have accents that are more similar to those of the West or Midland.  The same might be true for the Inland North.  Read this.  Specifically read p. 139 where it says Transitional Cities.  It explains this a little bit, though not as much as I would want it to.  Maybe you can find a more in depth explanation elsewhere, like in the real Atlas of North American English.  That's all I have to say.   \"\n",

The Scotland one was created \"\"because there's one on England\"\", hardly a good reason. The generally shambolic nature of the Irish material can't be overstated: Kings of Tara, King of Ireland, High King of Ireland, Irish kings and List of High Kings of Ireland need revising and magimixing; a large part of the material is List of legendary kings of Britain-esque and in no sense historical. I haven't looked at the Welsh material and how, if at all, it corresponds.

      "People need to seriously stop calling what goes on at this talk page the forming of 'consensus'. This lastest round included, it is at best just a series of long and rambling discussions involing the 'regulars' making and repeating ad nauseum the same largely POV points, and which always bizarrely seems to end in a vote or other exercise in 1-member-1-voice form of accounting. There's not a single thing about that process which is encouraged on Wikipedia if the goal is to actually form WP:CONSENSUS. The fact that as ever the process has not a single element of independent review or summarisation, and has been as ever completely lite on policy, guideline or reference to common good practice on other peer reviewed articles, only underscores that. And right to the end we still bizarrely had claims that keeping the footnote was acceptable, due to the rather obvious fact that these unproductive rambling sessions more often than not end up with no discernable support for doing anything, so leaving the article in a state in which it could never become Featured because it's such a giant policy violating crap bag, somehow turns out to be the 'consensus'. It cannot be so, by definition. The current version still has major issues, but at least they are now out in the open in plain text, and can at some point be addressed cluefully and independently and without tedious claims that it is the 'consensus' version that can be repeatedly edit warred over to maintain. It's not, and thus it cannot.\n",

Our employees had begun to notice that software which they had authored and placed under the Symbolics' copywrite notice had started showing up in the software released to other licensees but without the Symbolics copywrite notice.  One of our employees, Dave Andre, extracted MIT Lisp machine screen session copies from various Lisp machines in the AI Lab and found that Richard Stallman had been the one removing the Symbolics copyrights and giving our software to the other Licensee, LMI.  Andre made paper copies of the incriminating screen sessions.\n",

Of course, when I negotiated that license, I had intended and stated carefully in the license that licensee produced enhancements would be copyrighted and not made available to competing licensees.\n",

      "Greenblat had represented the AI Lab as well as his own company, LMI, during the negotiation for the license which both LMI and Symbolics ultimately executed.

      "Æµ§œš¹  You asked me to cite other inaccuracies in the Wikipedia article on Ebonics.  I direct your attention to the Wikipedia article on the “Oakland Ebonics Controversy”.  The Wikipedia article states:  “For students whose primary dialect was AAVE, the Oakland resolution mandated some instruction in that dialect, both for \"\"maintaining the legitimacy and richness of such language... and to facilitate their acquisition and mastery of English language skills.\"\" This also included the proposed increase of salaries of those proficient in both AAVE and Standard English to the level of those teaching LEP (limited English proficiency) students and the use of public funding to help teachers learn AAVE themselves.[1]”      This not accurate.  In fact it is an outright lie.   In the first place, the OUSD Board's December 18, 1996, resolution was not about children who speak African American Vernacular English, Black English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the specific basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution.  The OUSD December 18, 1996 resolution was concerning children whose parents had identified their home, native or primary language as (1) \"\"Ebonics\"\", (2) \"\"Pan African Communication Behaviors\"\" and/or (3) \"\"African Language Systems\"\".   As proof of this assertion I cite the fact it that the appellations African American Vernacular English does not appear anywhere in the entire OUSD resolution.  In fact the first four Whereas clauses of the OUSD resolution speak only to the existence of a linguistic continuity of the West Niger-Congo African language system in the language of African slave descendants and their unique language stature.   The very first whereas clause of the OUSD resolution states: WHEREAS, numerous validated studies demonstrate that African-American students as part of their culture and history as African people possess and utilize a language described in various scholarly approaches as “Ebonics” (literally Black sounds) or “Pan African Language Communication Behaviors” or “African Language Systems.”  [For more information relative to the appellation “Pan African Language Communication Behaviors” see Pan African Language In The Western Hemisphere (1973)]  The second Whereas clause of the resolution states: “Whereas, these studies have also demonstrated that African language systems have origins in West and Niger-Congo languages  and are not merely dialects of English”.   Now what more evidence does it take to prove that the OUSD resolution was not about African American Vernacular English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution?\n",
      "Here is more.  A critical analysis will reveal that in its very essence the OUSD resolution was about the vindication of the equal protection of the law rights of the Afrocentric parents and their children under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  That is, the right of English Language Learners (ELL) of African ancestry to not be discriminated against on the basis of their language ancestry and provided instruction in the English language as a second language, i.e.,ESL.  In short, to be provided a Free and Appropriate Public Education.   As proof of this assertion I cite the fifth whereas clause of the OUSD Board's resolution which reads: \"\"Whereas, judicial cases in states other than California have recognized the unique language stature of African American pupils, and such recognition by courts has resulted in court-mandated educational programs which have substantially benefited African American children in the interest of vindicating their equal protection of the law rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the  United States Constitution.\"\"  (See OUSD resolution page 1. para. 5.)  As further evidence that the OUSD Board's resolution was about \"\"Ebonics\"\", \"\"Pan African Communication Behaviors\"\" or \"\"African Language Systems\"\" and not African American Vernacular English, I cite the fact that first ‘Now Therefore Be It Resolved’ clause of the OUSD resolution states: “NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED the Board of Education officially recognizes the existence of, and cultural and linguistic bases of West and Niger -Congo African Languages Systems and these are the language patterns that many African American students bring to school;”  Clearly based on this passage of the resolution what the OUSD Board was addressing was the existence of  \"\"Ebonics\"\", \"\"Pan African Communication Behaviors\"\" or \"\"African Language Systems\"\" and not African American Vernacular English.   The second “Therefore be it resolved” clause of the OUSD resolution states:  “BE IT RESOLVED that the Board of Educ\n",

In addition to rebaptism after removal of one's name from church records* , a bishop may approve a rebaptism for a token of repentance rather than merely membership in the Church. A reference: [W]e had a wonderful older brother in my branch with a gambling addiction.   When he was finally able to overcome it, and despite no official Church punishment, he petitioned for and was granted rebaptism, to witness again to his God, his Church, his family, and (maybe most importantly) himself that he was born again.   Technically, all this good brother needed was the Sacrament of the Lord's Last Supper, but can't you imagine how much more staying power the Sacrament of Baptism and Rebirth has had on his determination?

Companies that have committed themselves to buy feedstock or wafers at high prices for the next several years are going to have bigger problems than those who have some flexibility in their contracts, for example. It will also depend on how their lines are set up on how reliant they are on manual labor (on cell production lines at large manufacturers I think you will find little reliance on manual labor in either country). But regardless, a tariff would push PV prices up just as they're finally beginning to come down. I don't that's a good idea. I also don't think it would have the desired effect. I don't have any figures on how much PV the US imports from China, but some 3.5% of US PV exports go to China. Furthermore, the US is still a net exporter of PV modules so for a tariff to have the desired effect I think it would have to be levied by some other government that is more significant to the Chinese PV industry.\n",

      " First.Regarding the above very respectable commentary by the also very respectable editor , I feel I must affix this preliminary response, as for the upcoming weeks I won't be able to build a properly documented reply. You say that I  'unilaterally and without a source named Guevara as an official \"\"executioner\"\".'  Not true, I did supply a reference  from a reliable source (Behind Che Guevara’s mask, the cold executioner Times Online (from The Sunday Times) September 16, 2007) that I later displaced downward. Yes, I am clearly not interested in the consensus of blatant leftist editors who regard Ernesto \"\"Che\"\" Guevara as their personal hero, or idol, or totem, who believe he should be thought of as an exemplary human being. If user Nubiatech feels offended by the word 'bullshit', I may also feel offended when he/she childishly calls 'POV' my qualification of mass executioner, which by the way is an historical fact, as many sources prove, and which should be familiar terrain to . With all due respect, when he states that \"\"...none of the scholarly journals, or major biographies refer to Guevara primarily in such a manner\"\", one wonders if he has gone through the immense mass of documentation available, for example, from Cuban exiles? The qualification to use should be mass murderer, which Guevara was, instead of the milder executioner. To display respect or deference toward an overt criminal is not only unjustifiable, it is plain hypocrisy.\n",
      "\n",
      " Second, the WP:NPOV guideline states:\n",
      " \"\"Balance\n",
      " Neutrality weights viewpoints in proportion to their prominence. However, when reputable sources contradict one another and are relatively equal in prominence, the core of the neutral point of view policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page: work for balance, that is: describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources, and give precedence to those sources that have been the most successful in presenting facts in an equally balanced manner.\"\", etc. \n",
      "\n",
      " Let's briefly examine what the lead section states about \"\"El Che\"\", to see if all viewoints are represented:\n",
      "  he was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary,  (sounds respectable enough, perhaps chic, even classy)\n",
      " (he was a) politician,                       (respectable enough)\n",
      " (he was an) author,                          (sounds very respectable)\n",
      " (he was a) physician,                        (very respectable indeed)\n",
      " (he was a) military theorist,                (respectable enough)\n",
      " (he was a) guerrilla leader.                 (respectable for some)\n",
      " It should be obvious that there is no balance at all in the above qualifications; they all depict a character that ought to attract admiration, to say the least, hiding the \"\"insignificant\"\" fact that he was a three-hundred-fold manslayer, even calling POV a reference to it. This is the logical consequence of the diligence with which leftist editors quickly delete anything that might mar their hero's image, and even cry foul (like  above) when anyone doesn't abide by their rules. This user even writes \"\"POV (not a fact) mentioned with due weight elsewhere on the article\"\" in his reverting edit summary. Question: if it already is mentioned elsewhere, why there it's not considered 'POV', while within the lead section it is? The marrow of the discussion is that we are not talking of viewpoints here, we are talking about facts.  \n",

And given that the claim was specifically examined on Mythbusters and it was shown to be improbable and that there is a lack of any test data that suggested it was remotely possible and the fact, that just based on common sense understanding of the nature of damping and resonances it seems improbable, stating it as fact in this Wikipedia article is incorrect I believe.\n",

      "The topic of mutual intelligibility in Slavic languages is a bit difficult. For example, Bulgarian is routinely regarded as a language most distant from the Slavic type and very difficult to understand for most Slavs. In Czech, there even exists a saying \"\"speaking like a Bulgarian\"\" for unintelligible speech. Yet the difficulties in understanding lie mainly in grammar (the non-existence of word-endings, the use of articles). You can listen to a Bulgarian, not to understand a word and doubt, if you are actually listening to an Indo-European language - and then you see a Bulgarian text and you are surprised that you can read it quite with ease. So the difference in understanding spoken language and written language can be huge. \n",
      "As for the difference between Czech/Slovak and Polish, I must agree with the Polish contributor above that a fluent conversation is not possible. Yet you can certainly understand a lot and conduct some conversation, if you try to be patient. So \"\"a limited intelligibility\"\" would be a more correct term. As for written Polish, Czechs and Slovaks shouldn't have any difficulties with a general understanding Polish text, although quite a few words (especially of technical sort) may seem obscure and untintelligible. However, the closest Slavic language to Czech (after Slovak) is Lusitan Sorbian, especially Upper Sorbian. I don't have any personal experience with this language, but from the written texts I saw I think that its resemblance to Czech can be compared to East Slovakian dialects (which means that you can understand some passages easily, but subsequently you can be lost due to accumulation of weirdly sounding words.)   \"\n",

And, like the samsung sentry, there is no competition for it. the sentry project website ranks higher (#1) than even the sentry gun wiki page proving even further that it is absolutely relevant. all the reasons which you make up in your head for the sentry project removal also apply to the samsung sentry proving your illogical bias. you couldn't come anywhere close to proving me wrong on that one either. at the very least the sentry project website should be allowed in the references or the external links. that sentience \"\"There are also real, fully autonomous sentry guns for hobbyists\"\" is singularly referring to the sentry project website.

THeir all worried about showing his picture publicaly, and this isnt even his picture. Apparently this picture has been distributed, even among Baha'is. These people havent even seen the picture in the archives. I cannot emphasize how different in appearance the two personages in the two photographs are.

My concern is to find language that reflects the fact that there are more than a handful of exegetes that maintain that the doctrine of the Trinity is contained in the Scripture of the Old and New Testament. They would admit, of course, that the term \"\"Trinity\"\" is not in the Bible and that the doctrinal formulas of later ages are not stated point blank. Yet they see the Scripture as a whole confessing one God, while confessing the Father as God, the Son as God under names such as \"\"The Angel of the Lord\"\" and the \"\"Word of Yahweh\"\" and the Holy Spirit as God. To me, \"\"some\"\" gets to that. Without extensive research, however, I cannot say how many feel that way.

      "Be careful adding from your own experience. That basically violates the Wikipedia:No original research policy. But that's simple to avoid, since if you've seen the effect, most likely someone else has. Wikipedia needs to be a secondary source, citing other published sources. So find a published source that finds the same thing, and the addition would be much better. Also it is liquid, as long as the repellant product bottles that say they are 100% deet really are. Also, just eyeballing from it's structure, liquid looks about right. I read a bunch of studies on DEET, and they all basically say it is safe as far as they can tell, but avoid overexposure as much as possible. A very small percentage of the time, some people (12 if I recall the study correctly, out of a large population) have a reaction to DEET. Basically the 60 years it has been used and the large amount of usage is strong evidence that at least the stuff is not really really nasty.

      "Connolley took control of all things climate in the most used information source the world has ever known – Wikipedia. Starting in February 2003, ... Connolley set to work on the Wikipedia site. He rewrote Wikipedia’s articles on global warming, on the greenhouse effect, on the instrumental temperature record, on the urban heat island, on climate models, on global cooling. On Feb. 14, he began to erase the Little Ice Age; on Aug.11, the Medieval Warm Period. In October, he turned his attention to the hockey stick graph. He rewrote articles on the politics of global warming and on the scientists who were skeptical of the band. Richard Lindzen and Fred Singer, two of the world’s most distinguished climate scientists, were among his early targets, followed by others that the band especially hated, such as Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, authorities on the Medieval Warm Period.\n",
      "\n",
      "All told, Connolley created or rewrote 5,428 unique Wikipedia articles. His control over Wikipedia was greater still, however, through the role he obtained at Wikipedia as a website administrator, which allowed him to act with virtual impunity. When Connolley didn’t like the subject of a certain article, he removed it — more than 500 articles of various descriptions disappeared at his hand. When he disapproved of the arguments that others were making, he often had them barred — over 2,000 Wikipedia contributors who ran afoul of him found themselves blocked from making further contributions… In these ways, Connolley turned Wikipedia into the missionary wing of the global warming movement.\n",

Now if you click on the genre on the aol page it takes you to a list of other \"\"rock & alternative\"\" bands . Taking a look at this list it is clear that rock & alternative is a combined list of bands from the rock genre and the alternative rock genre, as bands on the list such as AC/DC, Hinder, Daughtry, etc. obviously don't fit into alternative rock.

      "I have been to several Larouche meetings and I find it very interesting that the Larouche Movement advocates that we non-members are conditioned by fear (especially baby boomers) not to join their fight when on the contrary they use nothing but catastrophic speculations as recruitment. Larouche has been propagating perpetual nuclear warfare and the collapse of the economy for decades. I have personally been told that I would work at Starbucks after my degree (I have a well paying successful job today), the economy will collapse within a year (this was told to me a few years ago), and I was shown pictures of soldiers being hanged referring personally to my faith if I had not joined their fight to stop it. \n",
      "\n",
      "You see, by joining this movement, members take a leap over all their earthly problems by being placed in purposeful positions to save the world and receive immortality of the soul in return. Which depressed kid would not want to be placed into that fantasy world. The lonely recruits receive brotherhood; the ones who have failed in life are given intellectual reverence surmounting any non-larouchie, that’s a good opiate receptor! Many of these recruits come into the movement as empty slates to be filled up with Larouche tactics, this is why the Larouche YOUTH Movement has been the biggest sector in their existence. This is also a reason Larouche recruiters blatantly challenge their contacts not to listen to their parents, professors, or any adults with the explanation that they have become forever impudent by fear through degenerate cultures that us kids still have a chance to overcome. \n",
      "\n",
      "1) They believe in aristocracy, as their beloved and foundation, Plato does. It's interesting how their cause is to invest in the potential of every single human mind when their political system would be setup to discount and make decisions for the non-aristocrats, which would be us weaklings. And before one of you fresh Larouchie's claims this is not true, it had been recorded in a briefing. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) They want you to drop out of school because classes are setup as a 1-way channel between teacher and students, rather than, a pedagogue where everyone can facilitate the exchange of diverse ideas. I find this most interesting when i was accused of being a British operative in my attempt to exchange the ideas of philosophers and economic theories they were never exposed to. During a meeting my questions were brushed off and not answered, the speaker called them ‘academic’. The Larouche Movement is so organized that he has already conditioned his youth to negate any wake-up theories or opposing ones to be that of British conspiracy against mankind. In conclusion, this is no place to exchange ideas as they preach it is, it’s exchanging Larouche ideas or nothing. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Larouche writes thousands of pessimistic speculations, and when one inevitably hits, he is plumed to be always right as the others are forgotten. The speculations that are forgotten are thrown under the umbrella of economic collapse and perpetual warfare with only the future to hold the truth. Just read Larouche writings, he tells you that he is the ONLY ONE in the WORLD who can save us from these disasters. His intent and cause seem great, but what does his character tell you about the underpinnings; his Will to Impose himself on others? It is so blatant that even the purblind can see the egotistical style in his writings, remember, this is called the LAROUCHE Movement. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Larouche recruiters insult your way of living opposed to the thinkers, the ones who spend their time developing their minds in the movement. If the Larouchie’s are our saviors, if they are the brains of our renaissance, or even the brains of the world, studying Larouche mathematics, science, literature, philosophy, politics. Well how come none of the members ever made an invention or real impact. They really can use some invention to boost their popularity and finances. The reason this has not occurred is a great irony; these members are not self thinkers, they are followers, they study only Larouche and even with that knowledge they are too conditioned for Larouche to make new inferences.  \n",
      "\n",
      "All this studying and organizing only embeds the shackles on their minds. It is very unfortunate, because these members truly become psychologically stuck in the movement. It is very hard for one to admit to the Self that all these years were a waist of time and they must now step back to the miserable status of earthly life they left off at. This, accompanied with the fact that these members breathe Larouche 24/7, is why they will and are stuck beyond all fathomable realizations of the world.\n",

But let me add that when Positive and Negative Merger Foundation promotes the idea of a \"\"global village\"\" it secretly means \"\"global pillage\"\". What follows is a set of observations I have made about condescending jokers. Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's idolators have already started to rob, steal, cheat, and murder. The result: absolute vapidity, shallow and postmodernist cacophony, lack of personality, monotony, and boredom. Positive and Negative Merger Foundation likes scare tactics that bar people from partaking in activities that cannot be monitored and controlled. Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that I have to wonder where it got the idea that it is my view that \"\"metanarratives\"\" are the root of tyranny, lawlessness, overpopulation, racial hatred, world hunger, disease, and rank stupidity.

When I state that Positive and Negative Merger Foundation is a faithful student of Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese strategist who advocated demoralizing one's enemy as the highest art of warfare, I'm merely trying to deal with the relevant facts. Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's true goal is to palm off our present situation as the compelling ground for worldwide deconstructionism. All the statements that its operatives make to justify or downplay that goal are only apologetics; they do nothing to build bridges where in the past all that existed were moats and drawbridges. \n",
      "Despite what you may have been taught in school, I welcome Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's comments. However, Positive and Negative Merger Foundation needs to realize that we must undeniably raise a stink about Positive and Negative Merger Foundation and its insipid perversions. Does that sound extremist? Is it too brainless for you? I'm sorry if it seems that way but that's life. Given Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's record of shady dealings, we can say that its squibs are eerily similar to those promoted by madmen such as Pol Pot. What's scary, though, is that their extollment of commercialism has been ratcheted up a few notches from anything Pol Pot ever conjured up.

The DC arc largely applicable to ferrous metals, benefits from using 2% thoriated tungsten (or 2% ceriated tungsten, an alternative to the radiological concerns of Thorium), while nonferrous metals such as aluminum and magnesium requiring AC current, are performed best with pure tungsten allowing the tip to melt into an enlarged balled surface at the end of the electrode.

AlumaPrep (or some brand name like that), is simply an acid rinse to remove stubborn anodizing and any last marks of finger print oil from the 'touchy' AC needing metals.  But as Triddle pointed out in his explanation of +/- wave form capable machines, the plasma itself will often do a fine job of burning off simple surface impurities.  Deep inclusions (ubiquitous in sand casted work) are a frustration all unto themselves.  Welder (the person) tolerance, patience, and experience must often judge what level of weld quality exist after cooling.  High-tech work, demands that the work piece billet is good stuff to begin with, yet there is a variety of filler rod that can be used to accommodate persnickety base material.  Nickle, Bronze and \"\"Everdure\"\" (brand name) are often blended into filler rods, and greatly assist the welder trying to fix cracked engine blocks or other sandy and oil impregnated work pieces.\n",

      "Reactor vessels of all types, be they nuclear or cellular, are also a field unto themselves.  As the physical strength of a finished weld may really be the lesser of engineering concerns.  Chemistry plays a role in both questions of what will actually be held in the vessel, and how it may be cleaned between use.  Low carbon 316 SS (316L) commonly desired for biomedical applications where autoclaving and bleach will still kick the ass out of Stainless Steel.  Titanium and its many grades are like wise a subject for deep thought, but once the decision is made...  it works like soft butter, and few other welds can look so nice raw.\n",

      "A hot horse shoe is hot, and most animals with any brain will let go of it before they get burned too bad.  Therefor, direct and immediate sensible surface heat, is far less of real danger than the intense UV of the plasma arch as Gaiusjuliuscesar talked about 'sun burn', often called \"\"flash burn\"\".  Fully covering any skin, just as one might wish to reduce sun burn.  It's the same stuff.  Welders, responsible ones, will even clear a room of bystanders, even ones who \"\"know not to look into the light with out a hood\"\".  Side vision (looking off to one side) doesn't work either, as the cornea and retina damage (not dependent on center of focused vision) is extremely painful when experienced, (ya, I know) and not felt for many hours after excessive exposure.  \"\n",

I think that the first sentence can be broken up into three different sentences addressing the purpose and challenges in application and decomposition. As it reads it is just a little hard to follow. Also the term breakdown is used several times, and I was wondering if the term decomposition could be used interchangeably. Overall I think that the intro hits all the areas that it should, and the content is good. I do think that it need a little restructuring though.\n",

If you remove the two sentences I think it would be more fluid. I really like how you covered a large timespan.

Also in the first sentence you mention that some of polymers, such as proteins, contain amide bonds.  I think a nice addition to the scheme next to biopolyesters would be biopolyamides and a following box labelled peptides. I notices that you mention it in the next section and it may be a good place to show it in your scheme. I really like the properties section of your article, you address a lot of challenges with respect to degradation.

In the second paragraph there seems to be an error in your wiki language. There is the word oxygen that looks like this: [[oxygen[[. In the paragraph following your scheme, there is a sentence explaining the challenges for enzymes to evolve to accommodate the synthetic polymers. I there really like it and I think it is full of information. Although, I think that this sentence is crucial, I also think that it could be worded better.

Now the stuff I thought that could be changed: I think that the first sentence of the second paragraph could be removed completely and the paragraph would be fine. In the third paragraph there is a sentence where you use the term in vitro twice. I think that second usage could be removed. Also, I got a little confused in the example sentence about rat smooth muscle tissue. I really like the term \"\"holy grail\"\", not sure if this was intended to be a monty python reference, but it should of been.

      "Again, I disagree. Scholarly consensus has been moving towards the direction of inclusiveness (particularly for the question of the Roma and the disable). In fact, as you go through modern academic literature (the last 20 years), \"\"Holocaust\"\" more and more includes non-Jewish victims. Just an example: Alex Callinicos, from York University, (2001) The Holocaust isfor good reasons I need not rehearse heregenerally held to be the most extreme case of human evil. All the different kinds of domination fused together in Auschwitzracism, directed at Jews, Slavs, and Roma; the economic exploitation of slave labour; the oppression of gays and women; the persecution of dissenting minorities such as Communists and Jehovah's Witnesses. Or Slawomir Kapralski, \"\"Identity Building and the Holocaust: Roma Political Nationalism.\"\" I have already mentioned Sybil Milton (who was a senior historian at the Research Institute of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum), and Henry Friedlander, a leading Holocaust historian in the USA, is another important voice. This increasing consensus has had an impact on common language , as well on political bodies. See this press release from the UN, for instance. It is not a question of ranking victimsit is the concept of hte holocaust as a racist, mordern project, and the common fate of the victims. The famous pictures of Mengele's twins are of Roma children. The technology and expertise for mass murder was developed for the disable in the T4. The tactics of Eisengruppen were first developed in the invasion of Poland, against Polish leaders. I have seen several good arguments that convinced me of the centrality of Jews in the Holocaust; I have never seen a convincing argument for their exclusivity.\n",
      "If this is not enough, let me try in another way: by deciding to describe the Holocaust as an 'exclusive' Jewish event, wikipedia is taking sides in a ongoing scholarly debate (I could say on the 'declining' side of an ongoing scholarly debate). this is NOT holocaust denial, with no legitimacy in the academia, and it must receive more than mere lip service in the body of the text or in the footnotes.

Hugger fans are no different from any other ceiling fan in any way, except for the fact that they don't have a downrodsomething which is entirely unrelated to the fan's operation. The motor, blades, etc. is no different. Refer to the section \"\"Bases for Comparison\"\", subsection \"\"Height of the fan relative to the ceiling\"\", for more info on huggers if you're interested. That section details their sole disadvantage; it is appropriate for it to be in that section since it is not a problem unique to huggers (though all huggers have it). The sole advantage of a hugger is that it saves spacesomething which is such blatantly obvious common sense that it doesn't belong in an encyclopedia article (any more than the statement \"\"water is wet\"\" belongs in the article on water). Basically my point is that huggers are no different from ordinary fans, and so don't deserve their own section any more than each decor-themed fan at Home Depot deserves its own section.\"\n",

Is there any way to call a moderator or administrator to this debate to stop Bethereds reverts? He seems to have no proper reason as to why he is omitting the information other than he believes Korea is better than Japan (I've read his user page and looked at his previous edits and he seems to be doing anything he can to promote Korea over Japan). Does he not realise that in these games, even Chang and Kim (from KOF) speak in the Japanese language and have never even uttered a Korean word? We need a vote or something to put him right.

I like those terms because they shock the conscience in that everyone knows what those terms mean with regards to Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. It was the passage of the so-called \"\"Race laws\"\" of the 30s that led to the Holocaust of the 40s - there was a cause and effect.\n",

      "Now with that preface out of the way I am stating that the 1215 Magna Carta contains the smoking gun of England's own move to rid the Isles of the Jews. This is not hidden history but well documented history. It is just not talked about because the English (I am English) don't want to be thought of as being antisemitic, but English history reeks of antisemitism.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is not being addressed here (and even less now that someone has added the censor's touch), is that the Pope of Rome (there were other Popes), controlled England through his king; church and law (there was no secular law as such that was not santioned by the Church and the Church was the one Church based in Rome. I hope everyone knows about Henry VIII so that I don't have to explain that as well.)\n",
      "\n",
      "So the Jews were moneychangers. Why were they moneychangers? Go and do your own research! You need to know. The Jews had a moneychanger relationship with the Church and that is why the clause is in there: the Jews were (are) not Christians (duh!) - not members of the Church of Rome. The Pope gave them special status. The representative for all of the wheeler-dealing was the Archbishop. The barons were merely local gangsters, or in today's understanding = warlords (thugs.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The statements about the Jews in Magna Carta was not intended to educate readers as to who the Jews were - everyone knew who the Jews were. They were the People of the blood libel (\"\"they killed Jesus\"\"). The Church whose Jesus the Jews killed put up with them like the Nazis used Jews when it suited them and some Jews (a few) went along with the Nazis to save themselves at the expense of the majority of Jews. This is the thorny issue we are dealing with. Under English law the Jews were forbidden to do practically anything else but be moneychangers! They were the scum of society and the Church had a need for a sub-class of human beings. The Jews did not have the same status as everyone else and the Jews were murdered and abused. Because of the holier than thou attitude towards ethnic cleansing in the world today, the English do not want to admit that they were at it long before Herr Hitler got into the business!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now move along to 1297 and \"\"bingo!\"\" = no Jews. Why? Because they were kicked out of England, forced to go underground or convert. Same thing happened in Spain. (Hello, isn't that what happened in Nazi Germany?) It was not until the time of Cromwell - long after Henry VIII told the Pope bye, bye and long after Shakespeare wrote his own infamous words about a moneylending Jew that Cromwell talked about religious tolleration. Why? Because Cromwell ruled the English Republic which had severed its relationship with the Church by chopping off the head of the king; abolishing the House of Lords and raiding all of the Church properties to put them out of business. Then the forces of the Republic went to Ireland and engaged in \"\"ethnic cleansing\"\" by wholesale murder and mayhem.\n",

      "I don't know that it is all that clear. Identical? Aerians insisted that the observance of Easter was a Jewish superstition and they fasted on Sundays. Not very Protestant. The Vigilantians argued against the veneration of relics, the sending of alms to Jerusalem, the rejection of earthly goods and the attribution of special virtue to the unmarried state, especially in the case of the clergy. No mention of the Bible, no mention of justification, nothing else Protestant. All that is known about Helvidius is that he did not believe in the Virgin Mary.  That doesn't exactly make him a Protestant. Identical is laughable - there is no evidence to back up such an assertion. Wikipedia is not about truth, it is for fact that can be cited with recognized secondary sources of evidence.\n",

      "You went on:\n",
      "This becomes even more obvious when we consider the fact, that the Waldensians, the Lollards and the Hussites joined the Reformation and often mixed with various Protestant groups. The Waldensian Church, still existing in Italy, is considered a Protestant group and not a sect, as User:Secisek tries to imply. This is because all key beliefs the Waldensians have professed since the 12th century are common to most Protestant groups and are different from those professed by sects considered heretical by both the Catholics and the Protestants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whoa, I did not imply they were a sect, I wrote that they were. I intended no offense with that word. The Waldensians were a sect, and they revised their doctrine at the Reformation to conform to the new Protestant thinking. This is taken from the Waldensian's article:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"In 1532 they met with German and Swiss Protestants and ultimately adapted their beliefs to those of the Reformed Church. Moreover, the Waldensian absorption into Protestantism led to their transformation from a sect on the edge of Catholicism that shared many Catholic beliefs into a Protestant church adhering to the theology of John Calvin, which differed much from the beliefs of Peter Waldo. From that moment the Church became the Italian branch of Reformed churches.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This contradict your assertion:\n",
      "The Waldensians have never altered their key beliefs, they are considered Protestants and still they had existed for over 3 centuries before the proper Protestants and the Reformation. Many scholars have used the term proto-Protestants in their articles, although there do exist historians who argue that the term should not be in use for various reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact is, they have altered their key beliefs - that is what made them Protestant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is, however, that the Catholic historians often argue against the term to show that Protestants appeared only in the 16th century, while before them, there was just one Church of Christs and many small sects. For this reason even Waldensians, now considered a part of the Protestant Church even by the Church of Rome, are called a sect by Catholic historians. This dychotomy is absurd, as it implies that the Waldensians were at first a sect and then a Protestant group, while they have never changed their beliefs in the course of History. If the Waldensians are Protestants now, and they maintain the same views they professed in the late 12th century it means, that they have always been Protestants, even when the term had not been in use.\n",

The Beatles had no involvement whatsoever with any aspect of the albums. Indeed, they came out in the United States about two weeks before their UK release. Also, the two albums were compiled, at least in part, as a response to a heavily promoted bootleg, The Beatles Alpha Omega, a 4-record, 4-tape set that came out in 1972 and was even advertised on television in the U.S.; the boot's availabiliy made the point that there was no true \"\"greatest hits\"\" collection of the Beatles available in America at that time.  \n",

      "I have removed the claim that the Beatles chose the colour red for this album to show support for Liverpool F.C. Aside from the fact the other album is blue so we might as well suggest that indicates that they must be Evertonians, it's unsourced and extremely unlikely to be true. There has been a request for a source and none has been provided. In fact, there is no source for the claim that the Beatles helped select the tracks or helped with the album design at all (I seem to remember reading that McCartney did but not the others, though they may have done I suppose). Forgive me if I am wrong, but the suggestion that the Beatles picked red to show support for LFC sounds as though it's been made up by a Liverpool fan who either assumes this is the case or would like others to think it is. Some Liverpool fans like to proclaim that the Beatles were keen Liverpool supporters when in fact there is no evidence for this and almost certainly no truth to in it whatsover, and it's interesting that the contributer in question did not go over to 1967-1970 to make any similar reference to the choice of the colour blue indicating the Beatles' affection for Everton FC. Fact is, only one of the Beatles were even remotely interested in football (McCartney) and strictly speaking, he is an Evertonian (although he maintains he supports both clubs). Ringo, according to the Guardian, is an Arsenal fan. Neither George or John had any interest in football whatsoever and it is unknown which if any team they favoured, even there families don't know, although Harrison did seem to imply once that he supported Tranmere Rovers rather than Everton or Liverpool (Lennon added a Liverpool player, Albert Stubbins, to the Sgt. Pepper cover but later said he only did so because he knew he was his father's favourite player and that he himself actually knew nothing about Stubbs). There is a remote possibility that if the group were involved in the album's design that they may have chose red and blue in reference to the two Merseyside football clubs, but if it is so there should be a source for this and it should be made clear that this was not a show of support for one club over the other, which gives a false impression (whether intended or not).  \n",

The subjects involved, both MHFM and the others mentioned - may seem obscure to the general reader but are figures of note within the theological/philsophical schools of which they represent. The sedevacantist position is of serious interest to those studying the ramifications of Vatican II on the largest single religious denomination on the planet, and stands as a serious challenge to those who accept Vatican II and those who refuse and resist it (such as the Society of Saint Pius X) but still hold that Francis is a legitimate Pope (despite his endorsement of Vatican II). Due to the sedevacantist rejection of contempory Vatican authority it makes sense that there are competing schools within this segment of post Vatican II Catholicism, and in a culture obsessed with concerns such as \"\"What will Amanda Bynes tweet next?\"\" it stands to reason that they are paying much attention to debates over things like the rubrics of the tridentine rite. But it would be a disserve to the goal of the encyclopedia to ignore these intellectual schools of thought.

Unusual subcutaneous fibers are the unique objective finding. The etiology of Morgellons disease is unknown, and diagnostic criteria have yet to be established. Our goal was to identify prevalent symptoms in patients with clinically confirmed subcutaneous fibers in order to develop a case definition for Morgellons disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods:\n",
      "Patients with subcutaneous fibers observed on physical examination (designated as the fiber group) were evaluated using a data extraction tool that measured clinical and demographic characteristics. The prevalence of symptoms common to the fiber group was then compared with the prevalence of these symptoms in patients with Lyme disease and no complaints of skin fibers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results:\n",
      "The fiber group consisted of 122 patients. Significant findings in this group were an association with tick-borne diseases and hypothyroidism, high numbers from two states (Texas and California), high prevalence in middle-aged Caucasian women, and an increased prevalence of smoking and substance abuse. Although depression was noted in 29% of the fiber patients, pre-existing delusional disease was not reported. After adjusting for nonspecific symptoms, the most common symptoms reported in the fiber group were: crawling sensations under the skin; spontaneously appearing, slow-healing lesions; hyperpigmented scars when lesions heal; intense pruritus; seed-like objects, black specks, or “fuzz balls” in lesions or on intact skin; fine, thread-like fibers of varying colors in lesions and intact skin; lesions containing thick, tough, translucent fibers that are highly resistant to extraction; and a sensation of something trying to penetrate the skin from the inside out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusions:\n",
      "This study of the largest clinical cohort reported to date provides the basis for an accurate and clinically useful case definition for Morgellons disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keywords: Morgellons, subcutaneous fibers, pruritus, delusions of parasitosis, Lyme disease, skin lesions\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "Morgellons disease is a poorly understood multisystem illness characterized by stinging, biting, and crawling sensations under the skin.1 According to the Morgellons Research Foundation (MRF) website, more than 14,000 families are reportedly affected by this emerging disease.2 Considerable suffering occurs as thread-like fibers work their way out of the victim’s skin causing pain, itching, and open, disfiguring lesions (Figures 1 and ​and2).2). Unfortunately, patients are often dismissed as delusional by clinicians who are unfamiliar with the signs and symptoms of Morgellons disease.3–5 There is a scarcity of literature on Morgellons disease due to its relatively recent description in the modern medical literature, the reluctance on the part of the medical community to recognize it as anything other than psychopathology, and the lack of knowledge about its etiology and transmission.6\n",

      "The distinctive feature of Morgellons disease is the presence of microscopic subcutaneous fibers1 (Figures 3, ​,4,4, and ​and5).5). Observation of the skin with a lighted, hand-held, 30 × to 60 × magnifier enables visualization of these red, blue, black, and white fibers that have the appearance of either straight hollow tubes or wiry tangled threads.1 At times the fibers are seen above the dermis as loosely clumped “fuzz balls” or as black specks the size of coffee grains. Examination of the black specks by electron microscopy reveals that they consist of a tightly woven ball of black fibers.6\n",

      "RexCurry.net is the historian who made the following discoveries covered elsewhere and on Wikipedia:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The USA’s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis).  It was not an ancient Roman salute.  http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The Pledge’s creator was a self-proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the USA and his dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and his Pledge was the origin of their salute. \"\"Nazi\"\" means \"\"National Socialist German Workers' Party.\"\" A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).  Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent \"\"S\"\" letters for their \"\"socialism.\"\"  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized \"\"S\"\" letter for \"\"socialist.\"\"\n",
      "http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pledge is part of the USA’s growing police-state.  The insane government in the U.S. could cause comatose persons to Pledge dis-allegiance, desecrate the flag, and recite a declaration of independence. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a libertarian lawyer, Rex Curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere, to educate the public about the news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Government schools will never teach children about their Pledge rights, nor the truth about the Pledge and its author.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most comments fail to ever mention that Francis Bellamy and his cousin Edward Bellamy were National Socialists in the USA, wrote for and supported their \"\"Nationalist\"\" and \"\"New Nation\"\" magazines, the \"\"Nationalist Educational Association\"\" and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their \"\"Nationalism\"\" clubs worldwide, including in Germany, and that the bible of their movement, Edward Bellamy's book \"\"Looking Backward\"\" was translated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) under the National Socialist German Workers' Party (21 million dead), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (62 million dead), and the Peoples' Republic of China (35 million dead).  It is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up, but it should not be covered up.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the USA, the Bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education.  The government's schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy.  The USA's behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA's growing police state.  \n",
      "\n",
      "After segregation in government's schools ended, the Bellamy legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bellamy was a self-proclaimed national socialist in the USA, with the \"\"Nationalist\"\" magazine, and he preached what he called \"\"military socialism.\"\"  The federal flag darkens schools because Bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives.  Worse, Bellamy wanted the government to take over everything, not just schools. He wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society. School flags are a symbol of  nationalization, militarism, and socialism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the \"\"Wholecaust\"\" (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million killed under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers'\n",

Most of the houses in this part of the village are however abandoned even though the Church has been recently restored.

      "\"Actually, I became interested in editing this very short article (amid Wikipedia's invitation for us to participate in the survey, ending November 3), when all newspapers were flooded with Burlesque King. Nograles was forced to run naked in the hotel. Now, I was not a Wikipedian then, but, when, the landmark acquittal suit was published, I took time to edit this tersely. Nograles placed 2nd to my 1975 counsel in civil case, Atty. Henry R. Villarica, 92.35% higher than Ferdinand Marcos' 92.35% trimmed from 99% due to Marcos blunder in political law subject, in an En Banc review of his test results, 1939. Villarica owns more than 100 pawnshops, and is a very close friend-business assoc. of my brother, in gold and (they have 41/2 ha. Sta. Maria, Bulacan) fighting cock farm. I don't know Ateneo Law School Nograles, but due to the bar rating 2nd place, he is so brilliant. Now, in my 6,500 edits, I happened to have seen and edited like this controversy in bios of USA Senators, etc. So, I just follow the Wikipedia pattern. The difference between Dante Tinga and Nograles, is that, the former was cleared by the Court, but, the Nograles issue of censoring publication by libel lawsuit vs. the naked running, was condemned after Court acquittal for lack of evidence. In Nograles, the acquittal is best Wikipedia evidence to go forth with the edit on Nograles bio-naked thing. Remember the Beatrix of the Netherlands IP address fiasco caught by Wiki scanner? On August 31, 2007, Queen Beatrix’s royal family affirmed that Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau, 38, and his wife Princess Mabel Wisse Smit edited the entry on Wikipedia which described Mabel’s relationship with slain drug baron Klaas Bruinsma (using the queen's palaces’ computer). The changes were found by Dutch media using Wiki Scanner - the entry which states Mabel provided \"\"incomplete and false information\"\" about Bruinsma was changed to just \"\"incomplete information\"\" in January 2006. My point is, in Tinga and Nograles, irrespective of Court acquittal or clearance, the publication of the bribe and Nog's U.P. Oblation run, respectively, with reliable sources, licenses us, editors, to add \"\"the thing.\"\" On short edits, I respect IT and other editors, since, it is a matter of style. If I were not a judge or lawyer, or if I were not an A.B. communication, editor, then, like IT and math editors, I would edit with a sentence or 2. But I keep my edits to 3 sentences for this reason: links die in time due to pay per view, and, scholars or readers of Wiki must be provided with a choice, to read more meats or essential ingredients. Also, the libel suit was filed by Nograles, et al. and the subject is the naked run. Now Nograles withdrew due to affidavit of desistance, but, the other complainant did not, and the Court decided based on trial's evidence. So, with more reasons must the edit be there and at the very least, even a sentence, but the essentials of the naked run ought to be there.\n",
      "Final point. I do not personally know Tinga, but in 1978, I hired a lawyer of Santiago, Tinga, Fornier Law Office, to handle my simple Malolos case. Tinga became congressman and had been well known for this controversy, it is of judicial notice in IBP. Personally, I ignored these, until Douglas Anama, my text mate, the husband of Felipa Borlongan Anama, our Assistant Clerk of the Supreme Court (with the equivalent salary and rank of CA Justice) repeatedly approached me to consult dwarves, due to their case which Tinga decided against him, that's his family home. Tinga is not the only one who had these bribery things; Ynares-Santiago and M. Nazario (remember the Ramos notable contempt fine) shared the pie. My point is - the Court would instead put to rest the issue by fine or contempt. But for us editors, we just follow the pattern in USA bio of senators and public figures. Hence, my edit is well copy pasted from Wikipedia good articles on sub-section controversies. But of course, with all due respect to your edits. Sorry, for my TLDR, but it is so informative. Cheers.   \n",

Everyone can challenge the trustworthiness of Wikipedia projects and as stated, Wikipedia is not a reference. How can you prove that the argument that the title used in the three Wikipedias are more neutral and usage of WP:ENGLISH based on what? We don't know where each title at each Wikipedia follows Wikipedia naming convention rules correctly.

The user page contained some silly editing, and it might be debatable whether to call it \"\"use of Wikipedia for inappropriate humour\"\" or \"\"vandalism\"\", but at the most it might have justified a warning. An indefinite block on a user with a significant history of positive contributions because of a silly user page seems dubious, and for such a block to be imposed without any warnings is surely unacceptable.

CIA MKULTRA ran San Fransisco clubs prior to the hippy movement which emerged from that town, where patrons were 'spiked' with LSD. Ken Kesey learnt about LSD through his involvement in CIA MKULTRA experiments. He was a core figure in the burgeoning hippy movement. LSD did not leak into the 'youth culture' merely from medical sources, CIA had bought the majority of the world's supply of LSD, and this was a source and influence to the 'youth culture' movement just as important as Tim Leary. Even if you believe that the CIA kept its LSD well regulated, the internal CIA culture is not seperate from the US general culture to the degree you would purport to support your 'skepticism'. The experiences that the CIA officers and experimental subjects were having with LSD is just as legitimate an influence on culture as any other individuals experiences. 'Culture' includes and intermixes influences from everyone, CIA are not exempt, as much as some would like to pretend they are. \"\"We are all in this together,\"\" this \"\"lifeboat earth,\"\" this \"\"floating island in space\"\".

But with a ban, he'd just be restricted from those category pages and others' userspace. He could edit and talk in the non-categorized (econ, etc.)  and revert obvious vandalism type stuff. Now will he agree to a voluntary ban? I doubt it. He has not reacted very positively to my proposal. Instead, \"\"you guys\"\" must comply with his conditions, e.g., stop me, Rubin & SPECIFICO from harassing him. And consider his latest example. He cites one thread that was civil, verses the 116 diffs that I complied. (I'd proposed the Editor review to him before, but he won't do it.) Forgive me, Writ Keeper, if I complain too much here, but X goes on and on – not just on the talk pages. He creates new, lousy stuff, and then links it on other pages which have marginal relevance. (Example, his Scroogenomics article, created with three edits, and then linked here and there. So who contributed to Scroogenomics? X did 3 edits, 72Dino did 10, I did 9, Rubin, SPECIFICO, and the bot each did 1.) X asks if anyone objects to posting stuff, which can't be ignored because he'll take it as a green light for more lousy editing. Okay. I'll stop. Maybe I'll repost my .

I was thinking of enemies from the new range of books from the series i.e. The Clockwise Man, The Monsters Inside. There were some rather interesting enemies including Melissa Heart and the Mechanicals (which I could write a rather long article on) and maybe even the globs from The Monsters Inside. Or how about a sub category for the Blathereen on the Slitheen page? Please leave a list of suggestions so I can get to work. And is information allowed on if it has been confirmed by the BBC or DWM? \n",

For example in the character and history sections you could make an interwiki link on the word Villain by doing this: [[Villain]] and it would produce Villain. To link to an article with a slightly different word for example you wanted villainous to link to villain you would put [[Villain|Villainous]] and this would link the word villainous to villain.

      "\n",
      "First of all the Kurdish flag is allowed in Iran, but is not sanctioned publicly. Kurds have it in their homes and are allowed to have them. It is certainly not criminal in Iran for Kurds to have the Kurdish flag or symbol as many of my friends do. So edit your statement about it being criminal in Iran. Need I remind you all, that Kurds are ethnic Iranians and have historically enjoyed the greatest liberties in Iran as opposed to the mainstream discrimination Kurds face in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey?  \n",
      "It is usually Israeli sources, with increasing American and British help and aid, that intentionally falsely claim that the Kurdish flag (which fly the Pan-Iranian colours as does the unofficial flag of the Azerbaijani people and the flag of Tajikistan) is prohibited in Iran. FLYING THE KURDISH FLAG IN IRAN IS NOT CRIMINAL AS IT IS MENTIONED BY ISRAELI SOURCES. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, I go on to read that there was research done that basically proves Kurds and Jews are genetically the same. It seems to me that certain individuals who I can see are Israeli are following the Israeli states policy of editing articles in lines with current events in the Middle East. Kurds are Iranians just as how Russians, Serbs, Poles, and Bulgarians are all Slavic peoples. Israel, the USA, and Britain are trying to create conflict in Iran as was done in the former Yugoslavia by creating problems along ethnic lines. This is called ‘balkanisation.’ The Israelis are doing this covertly through operations in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Propaganda for dividing and conquering people starts with definitions then the manipulation of history. I am an academic in the fields of anthropology and history and an Iranian from a minority group that is neither Persian nor Kurdish. I can tell you that Kurds are definitely ethnic Iranians in all senses from tradition to language, history, culture, identity, and genetics. I am alarmed by the current purging of internet articles that have hidden agendas trying to separate the Iranian identity of Kurds. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I was told by a Kurdish professor, Mr. Eskandari in Tehran: “Kurds are Iranian and the entity of Iran as a state and nation was founded by the [main] ancestors of the Kurds, the Mede who established Iran as an empire. One problem that has compounded the issue is that people misuse the term Persian and Iranian. Persians are Iranian, but all Iranians, like the Kurds and Ossetians, are not Persians.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mede and other similar Iranian groups are the ancestors of the Kurds, but not the only group, just like how the ancient Persians are the main ancestors of the modern Persians, but not the only ancestors. Ancestors of Persians and Kurds also include Arabs, Mongols, and other Iranian peoples. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ask all the honest people on this site who wish to enhance knowledge not to take part in this fabrication of fact. There was a time when the Turkish government tried to convince Kurds that they were “Mountain Turks” and now there are powers at play that are either trying to disassociate the Kurds from their Iranian identity and origins or make whole generations of proud young Kurds forget or be unaware of their Iranian ethnicity. This is due to geo-strategic schemes. These forces are trying to victimize a whole group of people from knowing their own proud history and culture which is genuinely Iranian. The covert foreign policy of Israel, Britain, and America comes at the expense of the Kurds and even their history and culture.\n",

I would apply this to all non-circumcising cultures.  These people may not campaign against it or join the genital integrity movement (if you could describe it as such), however they would in general have a negative view of it.  There are a few reasons as to why I think they'd view it somewhat negatively once you forced them to give their view on it. \n",

Furthermore, those that are not circumcised would realise it is a needless operation because they had done fine being intact.\n",
      " What I am saying is that most people do view it negatively (if they know about it and are forced to choose), they just don't bother saying anything because they do not wish to cause upset to a religious community or be accused of being intolerant.  \n",
      " I am not sure what bizarre forced circumcision you are referring to.\n",
      " Regarding the term/title of the article, I don't see how calling the article Male circumcision would equate it with female circumcision.  I realise they are different operations, but they still involve cutting of the genitals.  You also cannot deny that a lot of people refer to FGM (as you would call it) as female circumcision.  Furthermore, a lot of people, when asked to define \"\"circumcision\"\" would ask the question, \"\"which type? Male or female?\"\" In the last post on this subject, at talk:circumcision, I said this and I don't think you or Jake responded.

The account had not been used for two years, so there was no urgency. There is a precedent for letting people in similar situations give a private explanation, and only to sanction them if they refuse or fail. It was not possible to provide public evidence without giving further publicity to a website which engages in stalking, and which gave speculation about not only SlimVirgin's identity, but also another contributor's. And you seem to be overlooking the fact that Cyde was in a longstanding dispute with SlimVirgin, so obviously should not have been the one to block. See also . This is not a question of making a mistake in believing WordBomb. This is a question of believing WordBomb, and then, instead of reporting it privately to the ArbCom, or asking SlimVirgin privately for an explanation, engaging in extremely inappropriate, hasty, behaviour, even crowing over the person he was accusing of sockpuppetry, and showing most clearly that he had a grudge against her. Additionally, in another case which is being heard at the moment, a user who had originally registered with his real name requested a name change, and repeatedly asked people not to keep referring to him by his old name, and Cyde responded by provocatively posting a link to the user rename log.

      "Are you kidding me? I have been blocked for defending myself against a culprit who has been proven as such in far more ways than is humanly possible to count? Even though the idea of Wikipedia certainly is a genuine one, the way it is conducted is ridiculous. Saying my opinion is NOT an attack, and saying what is TRUE is not an attack but certainly just a way to explain things, as I had done very carefully and thoroughly in my text both now and earlier. I will say it again, no matter how you interpret it. Mario Roering is a culprit with only one single aim in life. He wants to destroy the good name and legacy of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation and its president, Kunihiko Tosa. I am the president of this federation in Denmark and Europe, thus I am the center of Mario Roering's attacks and defamation. These are facts, and the list of violations not only here on Wikipedia but nearly everywhere else on the Internet is too long to list anywhere. I have tons of evidence in mails, papers, letters, pdf-files, copies of homepages etc. to back it all up. Personally I got fed up a few years ago because of these endless and ridiculous ways, with which the Wikipedia admins/sysops are handling this situation. So at that time I chose to simply leave Wikipedia as it was, and leave the articles the way they were, full of defamation, lies and propaganda, all put in there by Mario Roering. I gave it a few years, then this year I tried again. It is obvious that neither Mario Roering nor the admins/sysops here at Wikipedia has changed at all. It is the exact same situation as a few years ago. Other webservices, homepages, free webhosting etc. which Mario Roering has exploited for supporting his crusade, in the same way he is exploiting Wikipedia, has all deleted and blocked Mario Roering from using their services after a short presentation of the facts and evidence etc. Only Wikipedia is still indulging Mario Roering in his ways and methods with no regard to his true intentions and what he is doing to our organization and/or myself. The way I have been treated here on Wikipedia I would categorize as pure and utter slander, defamation and harassment, in which the admins/sysops take an active part, though this might not be on purpose?!?!? What Mario Roering is and is doing, there can and is no doubt whatsoever. Blocking me, only shows, that fairness, honesty and rules only apply to a very few list of people here. Taking this matter to any official long time instance/institute of Wikipedia, only ads to the fact, that nothing will ever be done about it, as nobody cares. You are protecting a culprit, who has done nothing else than attacking, ridicule, defame, slander etc. the name of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation, our president, Kunihiko Tosa and myself as the president of Europe/Denmark. I have a born right as a human being to say my opinion, present the evidence as they are, and I have a right to free speech. If none of these basic human rights are treasured here at Wikipedia, it only shows, that people like Mario Roering and his methods of breaking the law, copyright violations, defamation, slander and generally lying and deceiving to reach his goals are what is treasured here at Wikipedia. For 5 years, I have spoken out, bringing to attention this man's lesser morals and lesser ethics, but every time some ignorant admin/sysop run the errands of Mario Roering, as you have done this time, punishing me for defending myself. If Mario Roering would stop his attacks, slander, defamation etc. and if this would be enforced by the sysops/admins here at Wikipedia, this situation would be solved faster than anyone of you can say Christmas. Nobody is trying to stop it, thus, whenever Mario Roering attacks me, I attack back, not every time, but often. Blocking only me, shows only, that fairness does not apply to me, but if justice was to be served, we should both be blocked forever from Wikipedia. As long as nothing is done about Mario Roering, I will continue to do as I have done, and I can assure you, that Mario Roering has, is and always will continue his culprit ways as he has done for the past 5 years. Thus the Wikipedia sysops/admins who are doing nothing to stop it, certainly only put more wood on the fire. There is absolutely no attack intended in these accusations, as they are facts and every time I have mentioned them, I have provided the proof, evidence, links etc. necessary to back up what I have said. Every time Mario Roering opens his \"\"mouth\"\", you all listen and act by blocking me, threatening me or ordering me to take any dispute further using the official channels. When Mario Roering is blocked he only write a short request for having his block removed, and it is granted. Me, I can never do that. Where is the fairness in all of this? I have not taken part in any edit war, on the contrary, I have asked help and I have explain\n",

Still, though, I'm a total n00b when it comes to ratings; I'm revising the pilot, so can you tell me if you know what a 1.4/2 Nielsen Rating translates to in numbers?

      "\"==Passion Killing in Namibia==\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Cambridge Advance Learner’s Dictionary, passion is defined as a very powerful feeling, for example of sexual attraction, love, hate, anger or other emotions and killing is defined as the act of murder. In this context Passion Killing is combined.Passion Killing can be defined as the act of killing someone out of the feeling of extreme anger, love, hate or other emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past passion killing in Namibia was very minimal but now the number has gone up and it has become a trend. Recently, a large number of continuous Passion killing cases have been reported. So far it is only men that have been reported to have murdered women, breakups and infidelities being 2 of the main reasons amongst many.In this article I’m going to contemplate and discuss the causes of this aggravated passion killing in our society, who is at fault and recommendations as to what can be done to stop this type of violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The causes\n",
      "The question on everyone’s lips is, “why are men killing women?”\n",
      "\n",
      " Amongst many causes, the most popular causes of passion killing reported have usually followed from women who depend on men for financial support, for things such as accommodation, tuition fees in a case of a student, food, clothes and other essential basic needs and in this case, men tend to become possessive and feel they own the women and when women call it quits, the men usually feels betrayed and sour and end up killing the women.The Namibian, 2012Namibian\n",
      "\n",
      " Another major cause that leads to Passion killing in our society is infidelity from women. When a woman cheats and the men finds out, the feeling of betrayal usually overpowers the man and they end up killing.\n",
      "\n",
      " A possible cause could be the lack of self control and lack of respect towards women.Causes\n",
      "\n",
      "Who is at fault?\n",
      "As I have observed, both men and women are to be blamed in different cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, certain men are at fault are because they don’t seem to understand the real meaning of love. \"\"The country should cry out for help. True love is patient, love is kind - it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.. Bishop Kleopas Dumeni, 2012 \n",
      "\n",
      "Even if love is not involved, as it is in some cases, one would often feel that their ego is bruised or that their money has gone down the drain because they felt they had invested in something that they can own as property.In other cases men tend to become desperate for love and affection and end up offering material things and money to women to get some sort of affection even though the women have not demanded for it, In the end they feel they own the women and when they cheat or end the relationship they result to killing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Women are at fault in cases such as when they do not work hard to be independent and they accept all this material things because they want a chance at a luxurious and easy life at little to no cost. But little do they know that they might up paying with their lives when they do not stick to the person who is supplying with them with this sort of life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Women or both men and women are also at fault because they enter or initiate relationships for the wrong reasons, be it for money or sex and soon and in the end the differences start to surface, then there are misunderstandings and pain to one or both parties. \n",
      "Either way there are many different cases regarding passion killing and in  different cases either sexes are at fault but this still does not justify passion killing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "Recommendations \n",
      "The solution to this problem is a hard one to solve because it would require some sort of reaching out to the people of this Nation. Knowing the diversity of people, it’s hard to figure out what would impact certain people.  Never –the –less, the nation cannot sit back and watch this type of evil carry on. Informante\n",
      "A number of people have come up with reinforcing the death penalty. But I believe one cannot fix another evil with evil.\"\"So what is the exact answer to the problem, should we bring back the death penalty? Will it stop the passion killings?\n",

I think this article should be about any fronting/raising process triggered by a following high front vocoid, regardless of what language it's attested in. Likewise a-mutation shouldn't be restricted to Germanic but should include lowering caused by a following /a/ in other languages as well (again an example from Welsh: gwyn 'white (masc.)' < *windos vs. gwen 'white (fem.)' < *windā). Umlaut should mostly be about the written sign, with an indication that it also the name for processes like i-mutation and a-mutation.

      "As Roland perceptively noted, Sand's book is not so much propositive of a theory, as deconstructive of theories about a people. The most invaluable part of the book consists of a perfectly normal historian's history, i.e., of the socio-ideological forces influencing the construction of a modern collective Jewish identity. In this I am reminded of Martin Bernal. His propositive theory, which however took up far more space than Sand dedicates to the Khazars, was almost self-evidently silly. But his analysis in volume 1 of the modern historiography of ancient Greece as that was influenced by racial theory, is still regarded as a tour de force. One doesn't throw the baby out with the barfwater. As to genetics, Sand himself deals with that pp.273ff., and in so far as RS reviews challenge him on this, they cannot be excluded, even if, it's just a personal view, many of those reviews are incompetent and show a lack of familiarity with the book. The criterion should be, genetic criticism or evaluation of Sand should be admitted if Sand's book is specifically targeted or mentioned by those papers, and ignored if not.

Ahmadinejad never said that phrase, and what he was referring to, which was actually a statement of Ayatollah Khomeini roughly translates to \"\"[the usurping regime of Israel] should be eliminated from the page of the world\"\"  one could argue that a good translation for that phrase in English would be \"\"wiped off the map\"\", but that is not what Khomeni had originally said.  Nonetheless, Ahmadinejad was referring to what Khomeini had said and the Western media (in my opinion, Zionist-controlled Western media) suddenly blew it way out of proportion, for obvious reasons.

I didn't put the original reference to the Front in the al-Qaeda article; I merely clarified it. There are a lot of groups in Islam that don't like the United States or Israel. I realize that its easier to combine many of these groups into a general idea when talking about them, but thinking of the larger International Front for Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders, which is really more of a movement, as the same thing as al Qaeda, is perhaps too much of a generalization. You could generalize the World Islamic Front as loose enough to be the same thing as the International Front for Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders except that the World Islamic Front only has Islamic members.

Perhaps the reason there is so much more support for GW than global cooling in the 70's is that information and studies are so much more available these days.  Maybe the reason GW is such a big deal now is because places like MySpace and MTV make it so much more marketable.  Personally, I see a lot of hype and not a lot of proof.  \"\n",

Malyarchuk et al 2008 identified African L1b, L2a, L3b, L3d and M1 clades in slavic populations at low frequencies. L1b, L3b and L3d had matches with West African populations, indicating that these lineages probably entered Europe through Iberia. One lineage L2a1a, appeared to be much older, indicating that it may have entered Europe in prehistoric times. This clade was possibly related to L2a1 clades identified in 10 individuals of Ashkenazi heritage from France, Germany, Poland, Romania and Russia. L2a lineages are widespread throughout Africa, as a result, the exact origins of this lineage are uncertain. \n",

You added a lot of references to support your claim \"\"and to some degree Javanese culture; however it differs by being more overtly Islamic than the Javanese culture\"\". Yes, it is true they are similar to \"\"some degree\"\". But you could also say that Malays are similar to \"\"some degree\"\" with many other Austronesian cultures, of which there are thousands. If you look at the language classification  the Malay language and Javanese have over 1000 languages in the same language group. Out of those, the Malay language is in fact closer to many other languages such as Ibanic, Kendayan, Balinese, Madurese & Sundanese than it is to Javanese. So why have you mentioned Javanese specifically and not one of those other 1000 cultures, especially those which are more closely linked to Malay culture? You can of course find elements of one culture which have been adopted by another culture, but does that make them similar enough to mention? Its like saying American and Japanese culture is similar since they both like to play baseball. You could just as correctly say that Malays and Thais are similar \"\"to some degree\"\". The second part of the claim \"\"however it differs by being more overtly Islamic than the Javanese culture\"\" is wrong since it implies that religion is the only, or even the main differentiating factor. This is total nonsense.\n",

Becoming the TFA however is a different matter and some FAs have a year or more without being the TFA it depends on many factors as ultimately determined by Raul. Given that the rate of growth of FAs is AFAIK greater then one a day this isn't likely to change anytime soon. TFA is really somewhat seperate from the FA process, the only connection is that TFAs must be FAs of course. Being a TFA should be thought of as a bonus more then anything else and there's nothing intrinsicly different between an FA which has been TFA and one that hasn't; they're all FAs and if they not they should be put up for FAR.

      "\" is known as the al'Buraq wall to Muslims. I do not doubt in any way that is is known by this name by many Muslims, particularly some Palestinian and Jordanian Muslims. However, from everything that I've read, the name is of rather recent provenance, and was never known as such among Muslims until the foundation of modern Israel. If memory serves, it didn't really have any circulation until the last two decades or so.  from the obscure claims of Mujir al'Din that the Buraq was left there when Mohammad ascended to paradise, which itself is a legend derived from Sahih al'Bukhari, the provenance of the hadith itself being regarded by some as an addition of a later editor; that's of little relevance here, though. I see this has been mentioned on the talk page already in passing, and I don't advocate any necessity of removing it. However, the attribution itself is sixteenth century, and actual naming of it as the \"\"al'Buraq wall\"\" is incredibly recent. I think we should at the very least clarify this, add another source aside from an obviously politically motivated fatwa for the name, and perhaps move it somewhere besides the lead so we can elaborate on all of this. I just skimmed it, but I'm not even sure the fatwa actually names it as such aside from the title (nevermind, it does). For all I know, it may itself be the origin of the name, with this article helping to disseminate it. Since this, like every Jerusalem-related article, is contentious, I thought it best to get some discussion before I did anything.   \n",
      "\n",

      "I was wondering, from whom did the Jordanian capture the old city of Al-Quds and the wall? and why was the Jordanian rule over it considered occupation, while Israeli rule is considered sovereignty? I don't find this neutral? This should be changed.   \n",
      "The answer is in the article.  \n",
      "It is referred to as the Jordanian Occupation, because their annexation of the site was not internationally recognised, hence occupation. And while Israel's presence is also not recognised, (the last UN resolution on the matter calls for Jerusalem to be internationalised), in reality, Israel excercises its sovreignty over the site. As this matter is disputed, I did want to add a section on the current legal status of the wall and suggestions mooted during peace negotiations relating to future ownership of the site, but I could not find any good sources.   \n",
      "Jordan exercised its sovereignty over the wall for the period they controlled it, i think both should be changed to sovereignty or occupation. The Israeli rule is not internationally recognised either and if I'm not incorrect then the Western wall and old city were part of the West bank. Which is under occupation.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 90.193.16.207   \n",

But for the sake of neutrality, I believe Yamanam does have a valid point.

It seems to be talked about at various points as if it could be either, so I think that needs more clarity.\n",
      "Something quite important that I don't think was addressed at all (or at-least I couldn't see it) was the issue of how exactly the cable (or the whole structure) actually gets up into space in the first place. Are we to assume that the cable will be towed up by a rocket or something? If not that, then how?\n",
      "Several times in the article it is mentioned that the \"\"Counterweight\"\", could be an asteroid or a space station. But these two things are very different aren't they? I mean in terms of mass, an asteroid probably weighs millions if not billions of tons, whereas a manmade space stations would be only a few hundred or thousand tons (unless some gargantuan station is proposed). So how can these to things be comparable? And what kind of actual weights will be involved?\n",

The claim \"\"The meetings would have a great influence on the shaping of the modern country of Canada as well as on the Pacific Northwest of the United States\"\" appears in the beginning with a now invalid citation link, which isn't terribly surprising given it was listed in 2006. The issue is the cited material does not back the quoted claim in any fashion and nor does any historical narrative I have read. The diplomatic wrangling between the Americans and British for a few decades was over the Columbia River as a border (or not). Eventually the British agreed to an American proposal for the continuation of the border along 49th the parallel.\n",

      "Where does the PGO fit into this? It stated the 54'40 was the northern border despite having no control over any land north of the Columbia River. In 1845 an agreement with the local Hudson's Bay Company was established, with the company \"\"joining\"\" the government. Theoretical control was extended by the PGO, but the majority of the offices for the northern districts were held by the British.
