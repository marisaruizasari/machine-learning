I'm editing Wikipedia since 2010 and I can say that he is the lamest, weirdest, most \"\"dangerous\"\", etc. In my opinion being blocked indefinitely because of this is not fair (1~2 months is more fair). Sadly, blocking this user Hydao (who always fought against vandalism and addition of nonsense things) will not solve the problem. Sooner, the user GVnayR will start adding completely stupid and nonsense things on Wikipedia, which is unacceptable. I will continue fighting against vandalism and nonsense stuff (added by losers/nolifers like GVnayR), with or without \"\"Hydao\"\". Now you are thinking: \"\"Hydao, you are insulting a user by calling \"\"loser and no-lifer\"\", but that's not an insult, it's just the reality. A high-functioning autistic who doesn't work, doesn't have a job, doesn't have friends, use the government pension to buy PlayStation games and pay the Internet bill, someone who spend his days/months/years doing NOTHING useful (except making frequently STUPID edits on Wikipedia and wasting other ppl PRECIOUS time...) is a big loser who needs a LIFE LESSON. I don't mind if this \"\"Hydao\"\" is blocked, the only thing I know is that GVnayR needs an \"\"ULTIMATE LESSON\"\".

      "Thank you Gwen for re-stating my reply to Jdlund. I also complied with your previous block. As to Jimbo Wales and his claims of \"\"years of disruption on this article\"\", those are his opinions, however, 70% of the facts in the article are based on my contributions, including my photos of the tower (before the university corrupted the tower with it's cages and remodeling the interior to something way beyond what it looked like at the time of the tragedy. Paint, cages and other cover-ups can not remove the actual history. Sure there have been previous wars over the content. I have been involved for over thirteen years getting the documents, interviews and real history of the tragedy, while trying to correct the media's versions, which are full of errors and out right misinformation. If some of the articles on the net and in the history of the media were used, Houston McCoy would be \"\"George McCoy\"\", Whitman would be the Devil or evil (read Gary Lavergne's \"\"Why Did He Do IT\"\" on his website (this is the author of \"\"A Sniper In The Tower\"\", who claimed the tower tragedy was the \"\"Worst Mass Murder In American History\"\", which I fought and proved that Andrew Kehoe was the worst until Whitman). Also, in Lavergne's article, he claims Whitman would be alive as of August 1, 2006, if the Supreme Court had not banned the death penalty a few years after the tragedy, even though Whitman had a Glioblastoma Grade IV brain tumor that would have killed him within a year - even if he had not gone up in the tower. All Jimbo Wales has ever done is react to the protests and misguided rule benders like BZUK and Gavia immer, who know nothing about the tragedy or the rules of a valid contribution. They (Gavia and BZUK), are just like Wales, memes who have no knowledge of what they are doing, just applying their own personal bias' for what they blindly consider acts of vandalism, with no proof, and not even looking at the contribution and it's sourcing. Again, I have made valid contributions that even Gwen admitted would be appropriate if re-written by a more neutral editor, but what doe that mean really? 98.94.132.166  \"\n",

Yet if one goes to tsroadmap.com and/or lynnconway.com and googles (in the search boxes you would see on their pages) \"\"brain sex\"\" they will get many hits.    Read \"\"The theory that prenatally established brain and CNS   structures determine innate gender feelings and gender identity.\"\"  \"\"It appears that if those brain and CNS structures are masculinized   in early pregnancy by hormones in the fetus, then the child will   have male percepts and a male gender identity, independent of   whether the genes or genitalia are male. If those structures   are not masculinized in early pregnancy, the child will have   a female percepts and a female gender identity, again independent   of the genes or genitalia. As in the case of intersex infants   having ambiguous genitalia, there are undoubtedly many degrees   of cross-gendering of brain and CNS structures, so that while   some infants are completely cross-gendered others are only partially   cross-gendered.(verbatim)\"\"  This is basically the feminine essence theory. When one adds that there is only one way to be cross-gendered in the brain, and that cross gendering must be totally separate in any and every way from sexualorientation. That there is in essence one way to be feminine; that is the feminine essence theory.\n",

      "Interestingly if I understood JamesCantor correctly in a conversation we had on my talk page.  This is very close to what he and sexologist like him belive. However they contend that the way in which a brain is cross-gendered depends on sexualorientation.  Thus take a homosexual male.  Homosexual males have been shown to think and have some brain structures like those of straight women.  A homosexual transsexual is just a case where there is more enough female brain structure present to make a person mentally female.  While non-homosexual transsexuals, if I understood correctly, also have cross gender structures in their brains, just not the same as a homosexual transsexuals.  The non-homosexual MTF transsexual brains retaining more masculine brain structure.  That is the crux of the problem isn't it now.  That Blanchard's theory not only contradicts the feminine essence/ female brain sex theory of MTF transsexualism....but it then says ok one kind of transsexual really does work that way.

      "It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it had be\n",
