## Assignment 3: Option 3 - Food Recall Clustering

### tfidf vectorizer

I initially used the count vectorizer in the starter code but found that no matter how many clusters I had, I was still finding odd things grouped together (and that a lot of the descriptions had very long segments of repeating dates). I decided to use the tifidf to see if that would help reduce the influence of repeating words or ngrams

```python

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 3))

corpus = raw_data['product_description']
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

```

### Elbow plot 

Next I created an elbow/inertia plot to see if there were any points of inflection that could be useful in identifying a meaningful number of clusters. I initially did this for a cluster range of 1-100, but this plot shows from 1-50. I didn't find one major inflection point but rather a range between 5-15 in which the slope of the inertia plot really changes. However I found that using these numbers of clusters still resulting in confusing cluster contents (items that didn't seem to go together), so I raised the number of clusters.

![elbow plot](plots/inertia_50.png)

### Silhouette plots 

Here are a few of my silhouette plots for clusters ranging from 10-70. I also went as high as 300 clusters, but didn't find this particularly useful. All of these cluster numbers has clusters of just 1 item and then some with hundreds, so I got a bit confused figuring out what was actually meaningful. I'm still not sure if I should keep trying to increase the number of clusters to see if the groupings make more sense.

![elbow plot](plots/sil_70.png)

### Final clusters

In the end I chose 30 as my number of clusters, but as I mentioned above I would still like to play around with this a bit. I noticed that there are a lot of ice creams and nut butters! Those tended to cluster well, while certain items like fruit bowls and salsa/onion mixes tended to get put together which didn't really make much sense to me. More to explore!

I printed all of the descriptions for each cluster:
``` python
for cluster in range(0,cluster_count):
    item_count = 0
    descriptions = []
    for i in range(0,len(km.labels_)):
        if km.labels_[i] == cluster:
            item_count += 1
#             print('item number:', i)
            descriptions.append(raw_data['product_description'][i])
    print('*****************************************************************')
    print('CLUSTER:', cluster)
    print('COUNT:', item_count)
    if item_count >= 5:
        print('DESCRIPTIONS: \n')
        print(*descriptions, sep = "\n---\n")
```

The following printout shows all of the contents of my clusters:

```python
